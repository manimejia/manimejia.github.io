  title: Creative Web Architect
  byline: |
    integrating technical, design, and communication
    challenges into comprehensive web project solutions
  summary: |
    As an autodidactic digital professional, my unique superpowers are 
    curiosity, empathy, and optimism. Armed as such, I have sought out, 
    engaged with, and overcome a number of ever increasing architectural 
    and interpersonal challenges. With many successes and failures to learn 
    from, my work history reflects the same turbulent trajectory we all 
    humans must navigate; but these superpowers never fail. I continuously 
    will ask the tough questions, listen to the unexpected results, 
    and optimize the path toward progress through diverse conditions.

  bio: | 
    My career as a web designer/developer started in 2001, when I discovered 
    the multimedia possibilities of Flash. I was quickly engrossed, making 
    simple animations for family and friends. Within a year, I had learned 
    enough and made the right connections to approach the nation's largest 
    animal sanctuary with a novel idea for a virtual tour of their campus. 
    I landed the job, and set out in earnest to realize this 
    [huge accomplishment][P1] over the following ten months. 
    
    Early in my career I came to see that truly scalable and manageable 
    presentations need to have a smart backend to facilitate editing the content. 
    While continuing my work as a [flash][P2] [designer][P3] and [developer][P4], 
    I started to research CMS solutions on which these presentations could be 
    'hosted'. This lead me to Drupal, in 2006, and offering my services as a 
    website developer to an even wider client base. I spent the next few years 
    exploring the boundaries of modern web design, making [web][P5] [graphics][P6], 
    [small][P7] [business][P8] [websites][P9], and [applications][P10] for a variety 
    of clients. By 2010 I had established a reputation as an accomplished web developer 
    and solutions architect, working in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and whatever backend 
    technologies necessary address the projects coming my way.
    
    In 2012 I was hired as a web developer by the Graduate School of Oregon State 
    University. This was a great opportunity for me to move beyond self employment, 
    and experience the needs and inner workings of a large organization. I found myself 
    [rebuilding the Graduate School website][P12] from the ground up, designing functional 
    [user experience solutions][P13] for a variety of web systems, and streamlining their 
    [workflow processes][P14]. In September 2014, after moving to Ann Arbor, I worked 
    remotely for a few weeks until they had hired my replacement.
    
    With more than a decade serving various roles in the web industry, I have collected 
    a wide range of professional experiences. This has allowed me to identify and hone 
    my core strengths as solutions architect and digital communicator.

        and inspiring a world-wide cruelty-free movement. 

        As a web professional, I have been involved with the sanctuary since 2001. 
        This is when I first proposed a novel 
        [virtual tour](http://manimejia.me/portfolio/BFAS-Best-Friends-Virtual-Tour) concept, 
        to be built using Flash 5. The project was accepted, and for the next year I focused 
        on designing and developing this immersive experience. In the following 6 years I 
        would be called on multiple times as the "flash expert" for new projects.

  title: Digital Product Designer
  byline: |
    integrating technical, creative, and communication
    challenges into comprehensive software solutions
  summary: |
    As an autodidactic digital professional, my unique superpowers are 
    curiosity, empathy, and optimism. Armed as such, I have sought out, 
    engaged with, and overcome a number of ever increasing architectural 
    and interpersonal challenges. With many successes and failures to learn 
    from, my work history reflects the same turbulent trajectory we all 
    humans must navigate; but these superpowers never fail. I continuously 
    will ask the tough questions, listen to the unexpected results, 
    and optimize the path toward progress through diverse conditions.

  bio: | 
    My career as a web designer/developer started in 2001, when I discovered 
    the multimedia possibilities of Flash. I was quickly engrossed, making 
    simple animations for family and friends. Within a year, I had learned 
    enough and made the right connections to approach the nation's largest 
    animal sanctuary with a novel idea for a virtual tour of their campus. 
    I landed the job, and set out in earnest to realize this 
    [huge accomplishment][P1] over the following ten months. 
    
    Early in my career I came to see that truly scalable and manageable 
    presentations need to have a smart backend to facilitate editing the content. 
    While continuing my work as a [flash][P2] [designer][P3] and [developer][P4], 
    I started to research CMS solutions on which these presentations could be 
    'hosted'. This lead me to Drupal, in 2006, and offering my services as a 
    website developer to an even wider client base. I spent the next few years 
    exploring the boundaries of modern web design, making [web][P5] [graphics][P6], 
    [small][P7] [business][P8] [websites][P9], and [applications][P10] for a variety 
    of clients. By 2010 I had established a reputation as an accomplished web developer 
    and solutions architect, working in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and whatever backend 
    technologies necessary address the projects coming my way.
    
    In 2012 I was hired as a web developer by the Graduate School of Oregon State 
    University. This was a great opportunity for me to move beyond self employment, 
    and experience the needs and inner workings of a large organization. I found myself 
    [rebuilding the Graduate School website][P12] from the ground up, designing functional 
    [user experience solutions][P13] for a variety of web systems, and streamlining their 
    [workflow processes][P14]. In September 2014, after moving to Ann Arbor, I worked 
    remotely for a few weeks until they had hired my replacement.
    
    With more than a decade serving various roles in the web industry, I have collected 
    a wide range of professional experiences. This has allowed me to identify and hone 
    my core strengths as solutions architect and digital communicator.

        I was hired by the Oregon State University Graduate School to assist in the design and development of new web products, and to support faculty, staff, and students across campus in the use of their new and legacy web products. 
        
        In my two and a half years at the Graduate School, I brought usability to the forefront of importance for this growing academic department. While leading their [website rebuilding project](http://manimejia.me/portfolio#OSU-Graduate-School-Website), I was responsible for designing an effective content strategy, information architecture, and user experience. This required communicating clearly with and incorporating feedback from all content owners and stakeholders. During early development of their [graduate student application and matriculation system](http://manimejia.me/portfolio#OSU-Graduate-Education-Toolkit), I spearheaded the user experience design efforts, collecting and collating user stories, developing user personas, designing and user testing wireframes, and developing layouts and UI widgets using BootStrap and VisualForce.

        Since 2008 I have offered my professional services to Elite Care, working closely with the CEO and founders, to design novel and scalable solutions from the ground up.

        Best Animal Society has been home to the largest no-kill sanctuary in the USA for almost two decades. This is a forward thinking organization, who is responsible for reinventing what it means to be a humane animal care facility. Where others have failed with this difficult message, Best Friends has been a pioneer in nurturing and inspiring a world-wide cruelty-free movement. 

        As a web professional, I have been involved with the sanctuary since 2001. This is when I first proposed a novel [virtual tour](http://manimejia.me/portfolio#BFAS-Best-Friends-Virtual-Tour) concept, to be built using Flash 5. The project was accepted, and for the next year I focused on designing and developing this immersive experience. In the following 6 years I would be called on multiple times as the "flash expert" for new projects.

        &hellip; Manuel took the website redesign effort from mapping the old site architecture, developing a new architecture, creating mockups and working to incrementally deploy the new site in Drupal while working with content owners both in and out of the Graduate School.

        Manuel is a dedicated UI/UX developer who is not only skilled in CSS and JavaScript, but also has a passion for the client's viewpoint. When a new platform was thrown in the mix, he rose to the occasion and went from beginner to productive developer in short order. By thinking of the platform as an architected system, he isn't one of those guys that suggests 15 million different directions. Instead, Manuel sees how the integration works in a model view controller architecture and makes suggestions that make sense, are achievable, and can communicate his ideas not only in mock-ups but also in conversation. 

        If you are currently unhappy with the user experience being delivered to your clients, or would like to get it right from the start, bring Manuel on board and you'll be on your way to a pleasant, effective UI/UX solution.

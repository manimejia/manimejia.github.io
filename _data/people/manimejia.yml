# summary: |
#   Having 15 years of professional experience in the production of web and mobile software solutions, I am a holistic thinker and a creative problem solver with a deep understanding of the technical, communication and design challenges inherent to these projects. My experience involves work in all phases of digital product development: from understanding concept and vision to marketing a release; from collecting user stories to designing wireframes and UX deliverables; from crafting effective information architectures to contributing scalable front and back end code. My practice as a product leader, is to always steer boldly toward the possible future while making the most of the present reality. It is from this multi-level and can-do perspective that I offer practical insights to iteratively address every design, technical, and communication challenge.

#  curiosity, empathy, and optimism. Armed as such, I have sought out, 
#  engaged with, and overcome a number of ever increasing architectural 
#  and interpersonal challenges. With many successes and failures to learn 
#  from, my work history reflects the same turbulent trajectory we all 
#  humans must navigate; but these superpowers never fail. I continuously 
#  will ask the tough questions, listen to the unexpected results, 
#  and optimize the path toward progress through diverse conditions.

  Here are a few bits from my non-worky life:

  - An example of my goofy humor can be found in this [interactive animation](http://manimejia.me/fly) I made for a recent birthday party.
  - My wife and I co-designed our [wedding invitations and rings](http://manimejia.me/portfolio#MM-Wedding-Website-And-Invitations), because why not use the opportunity to find and express yourself creatively as a couple.
  - My portfolio website is all hand coded and hosted on [github pages](https://github.com/manimejia/manimejia.github.io). For free!
  - As a young man, I dedicated my life to master the art of [Didjeridu](http://manimejia.me/portfolio#HHF-didgeridoo-performance-with-stephen-kent). I played for hours a day, every day for ten years. I taught myself to be the best.
  - Iâ€™m an avid adventure cyclist and veg*n athlete.
  - I have two adventure doggies.


bio: | 
  My career as a web designer/developer started in 2001, when I discovered 
  the multimedia possibilities of Flash. I was quickly engrossed, making 
  simple animations for family and friends. Within a year, I had learned 
  enough and made the right connections to approach the nation's largest 
  animal sanctuary with a novel idea for a virtual tour of their campus. 
  I landed the job, and set out in earnest to realize this 
  [huge accomplishment][P1] over the following ten months. 
  
  Early in my career I came to see that truly scalable and manageable 
  presentations need to have a smart back end to facilitate editing the content. 
  While continuing my work as a [flash][P2] [designer][P3] and [developer][P4], 
  I started to research CMS solutions on which these presentations could be 
  'hosted'. This lead me to Drupal, in 2006, and offering my services as a 
  website developer to an even wider client base. I spent the next few years 
  exploring the boundaries of modern web design, making [web][P5] [graphics][P6], 
  [small][P7] [business][P8] [websites][P9], and [applications][P10] for a variety 
  of clients. By 2010 I had established a reputation as an accomplished web developer 
  and solutions architect, working in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and whatever backend 
  technologies necessary address the projects coming my way.
  
  In 2012 I was hired as a web developer by the Graduate School of Oregon State 
  University. This was a great opportunity for me to move beyond self employment, 
  and experience the needs and inner workings of a large organization. I found myself 
  [rebuilding the Graduate School website][P12] from the ground up, designing functional 
  [user experience solutions][P13] for a variety of web systems, and streamlining their 
  [workflow processes][P14]. In September 2014, after moving to Ann Arbor, I worked 
  remotely for a few weeks until they had hired my replacement.
  
  With more than a decade serving various roles in the web industry, I have collected 
  a wide range of professional experiences. This has allowed me to identify and hone 
  my core strengths as solutions architect and digital communicator.

      &hellip; Manuel took the website redesign effort from mapping the old site architecture, developing a new architecture, creating mockups and working to incrementally deploy the new site in Drupal while working with content owners both in and out of the Graduate School.

      Manuel is a dedicated UI/UX developer who is not only skilled in CSS and JavaScript, but also has a passion for the client's viewpoint. When a new platform was thrown in the mix, he rose to the occasion and went from beginner to productive developer in short order. By thinking of the [product] as an architected system, he isn't one of those guys that suggests 15 million different directions. Instead, Manuel sees how the integration works in a [holistic] architecture and makes suggestions that make sense, are achievable, and can communicate his ideas not only in mock-ups but also in conversation. 

#      If you are currently unhappy with the user experience being delivered to your clients, or would like to get it right from the start, bring Manuel on board and you'll be on your way to a pleasant, effective UI/UX solution.

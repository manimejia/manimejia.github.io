  As an autodidactic web professional since 2001, I offer user experience focused architecture, design, and development services in an iterative balance of careful planning, clear communication, and ‘roll up your sleeves’ good work.

        In 2012, I unearthed a deeply nested and recurrent pattern of content reiteration in the OSU Graduate School's legacy website, where critical information was communicated multiple times in various ways. Its resolution led to a content strategy covering the same information in 60% fewer destination pages, thereby freeing thousands of users from a frustrated and confusing journey. These efforts also saved the Graduate School hundreds of hours of redundant content maintenance and phone support.

        In 2013, I implemented a needed solution to the long standing problem of navigating the many available graduate programs and funding opportunities on the OSU Graduate School website. With the realization that this content represents 80% of their daily website traffic, I designed an efficient [search tool](http://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/programs) to improve this valuable user experience. What once required about 10 interactions for each user to find the desired information, now requires about 4 interactions on mobile and desktop devices.

    - project_id: EC/CareNet-Elder-Care-Portal
      description: |
        In 2009, during the requirements gathering phase for the CareNet applications, I visited many campus homes to observe the residents and staff in situ, I interviewed the staff to dive deeper into workflow specifics, and I worked closely with the CEO and founders to distill the product vision.  After a few weeks of such researching, brainstorming, and documenting, we came up with a comprehensive collection of wireframes, interactive prototypes, architectural diagrams, user stories, personas, and random sticky notes that defined the early product requirements.

        In 2013, I participated in the collection and collation of user stories for the OSU Graduate School's new application system. This involved synthesizing information gathered from hundreds of interviews with potential users. We reviewed each interview to extract the common and uncommon patterns. We simplified these findings into concise, categorized, and prioritized story cards. We then used these stories to refine a clear, confident, and prioritized list of product features, with use-case examples for each one.

    listening to and connecting stakeholder perspectives to ensure product efficacy
  accomplishments:
    - project_id: INFR/UA-Portfolio
      description: |
        In 2015, during a tumultuous product development cycle, I maintained clear communication with the designers, developers, project team, and investors. I facilitated a cross-discipline understanding of the undocumented requirements and unanimous agreement for their proposed solutions. This resulted in an improved working environment and a better product for the end users.

      description: |
        During this time I also participated in the prioritizing of customer feedback and developer roadblocks that followed every weekly product release. If the documentation was unclear, we met with the development or customer support teams in person to get the skinny. My participation in this process was especially sought after, due to my experience and accuracy in translating customer feedback and designing around product constraints.

    - project_id: MM/uix-javascript-controller-library
      description: |
        In 2015, I started an open source javascript library called UIX. This represents a novel approach to building accessible user interface widgets in HTML5. By using WAI-ARIA standard attributes to identify these elements and their intended interactions, I was able to provide “out of the box” semantic and keyboard navigable UI widgets, shaving hours of redundant work for “accessibility compliant” front end developers.

        Upon being hired at InfoReady in 2015, I dove head on into javascript development using AngularJS. It was my first of many adventures with this thick-client framework, yet far from a beginners lesson. With deep understanding of the application growing UI requirements, I was able to re-architect the entire front end to deliver a more polished and scalable solution in less time than other estimates.

    - project_id: BFAS/Best-Friends-Virtual-Tour
      description: |
        In 2001, I pitched, designed, and implemented a unique multimedia online tour of the Best Friends physical campus. While such a product was ahead of it's time, and typically out of budget for a growing non-profit, the roadmap I presented was practical and achievable, with clear benefits for all. Utilizing the RIA capabilities of Flash 5, we redefined the landscape of interactive web presentations, putting BFAS on the map with a dynamic Internet presence, and a handful of spinning furry friends.

      description: |
        In 2016, while working for an early stage startup, I led multiple brainstorm sessions to fine tune the direction and priorities for development work each week. This iterative design process led to rapid and evolving prototypes being put in front of potential clients at a regular pace. While each version was more complex than the last, we were able to incorporate every change into a growing and scalable product definition for future development.

#      description: |
#        In 2009, while researching the requirements of the CareNet system, I reverse engineered their undocumented legacy code base to discover its core processes and functionality. By incorporating these findings into the new application architecture, I saved Elite Care thousands of dollars in what would have otherwise been a “from scratch” code rewrite without the guidance of the legacy development team.

#        In 2012, during the Graduate School's website redesign process, I met individually with every stakeholder, to collect and integrate diverse requirements into a single project definition. This resulted in the creation of a new design that met everyone’s evolving needs while remaining simply architected and easy to administer.

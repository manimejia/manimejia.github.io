ManiMejia Portfolio Website
==================

This is the code and content for my entire [portfolio website](http://manimejia.me). It is built on the 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) platform, using [Noita](http://noita.penibelst.de) as a base theme from which I expanded. Other libraries and open source projects used are as follows:

- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.org)
- [skrollr](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr)
- [ICITA Aria Examples](http://test.cita.illinois.edu/aria/tabpanel/index.php)

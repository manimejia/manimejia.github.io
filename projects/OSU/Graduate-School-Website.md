  caption: Graduate School home page, showing a novel approach to information architecture.
    The image carousel (and the "boxed" content bellow it) presents "promoted" content
    from within the website, driving visitors to important information. The main navigational
    elements make use of typical "audience based navigation" typically found in academic
    sites, as well as "topic based navigation" found on most other informative sites.
    Additionally, this screen shot shows the use of a modern "Contact Us" button that
    stays within view while scrolling the page.

  caption: Important consideration needs to be given to potential international applicants,
    making sure they understand the particular requirements. We accomplished this
    need with a much simplified and improved content layout, making use of a callout
    box directing visitors to the relevant information. Also, take note of the care
    given to the side bar navigation, in keeping it simple and visually interesting.
- filename: gradschool-website-screen-notification.png
  caption: This screenshot highlights the "Notifications" tool developed specifically
    for the Graduate School website. Notifications appear at the top of website pages,
    informing visitors of contextually important and time sensitive information. They
    can be created and edited using a custom maintenance page. Each one can have an
    icon, static or repeating dates, and multiple website sections associated with
    it; these control how, when, and where it will be displayed.

  caption: This screenshot shows the main page for the "Graduate Programs" section,
    and highlights the many architectural and design features incorporated in this
    most popular of all Graduate School website sections. From the faceted search
    tool, to the expandable details, to the "tag-like" informative labels, this page
    is focused on helping visitors to find the right graduate major, minor, or certificate.  Each
    program listed has additional information available on it's own page, as well
    as important contact and website links available as icons in this list.

I led the website redesign efforts for this core academic department. This non-trivial task involved documenting and redesigning the legacy information architecture and content strategy, meeting regularly with content owners and stakeholders to assure their needs were being met, designing experiential solutions to meet the needs of a diverse group of stakeholders and users, and re-inventing the entire web presence of this institutionalized academic department to more efficiently serve its modern web-savvy audience.

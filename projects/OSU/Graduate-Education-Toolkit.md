It makes use of a searchable, sortable, and configurable table whose state can be saved and restored by the user. It also shows that selected applicants in the table are displayed below the table for deeper comparison and review.

I developed the applicant and reviewer expereinces for this campus wide applicant management system, spearheading the UX design efforts. I collected and collated user stories and developed user personas. I designed wireframes and user tests. I developed layouts and UI widgets using BootStrap and VisualForce.

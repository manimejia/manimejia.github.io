   caption: This wireframe outlines a novel interface used by program administrators to find and review graduate applicants. It makes use of a searchable, sortable, and configurable table whose state can be saved and restored by the user. It also shows that selected applicants in the table are displayed below the table for deeper comparison and review.

tasks: 
  - Designed comprehensive documentation of the legacy database used for managing graduate   student admissions and matriculation.
  - Used existing user stories to assemble a connected narrative, static mockups, and click-  through wireframes of the User Experience requirements for a new graduate admissions and  matriculation management system. 
  - Designed an innovative and efficient search and presentation experience for the   applicant review process.
  - Developed a collection of template pages to theme the application in the standard OSU   website style.
  - Integrated the use of Bootstrap 3 and a number of other open source libraries on the   template pages.
  - Developed and Modified Apex controller classes and VisualForce pages to suit the user experience designs.

tasks: 
  - Worked closely with company founders and CEO to develop the unique requirements for this visionary care management system.
  - Performed a full code audit of the legacy system, including detailed documentation of how and why it did or did not fill the current requirements.
  - Developed a new set of interactive wireframes that covered the whole care management process according to the new requirements.
  - Iterated through various wireframe designs, with feedback from user testing with staff.
  - Designed a collection of "care management" icons to support the application's user interface needs.
  - Developed a working MVP applicaiton, complete with custom datatypes, unique form widgets and workflows, and a "natural language" system for rendering structured data in a readable journal format.

tasks: 
  - Developed a new Drupal 6 website with a custom module, theme, and graphics to meet the client's specific requirements.
  - Worked with existing Photoshop mockups provided by the graphic designer.
  - Developed a unique SEO solution to present the different "field sets" of each community "node" at individual URLs. This allowed deep search engine access to the discrete   community information while maintaining a single editing experience for each community.
  - Developed a more integrated content authoring and editing experience, filling in where   Drupal has historically been weak.
  - Developed an integrated contact form solution, to facilitate booking tours at individual communities.

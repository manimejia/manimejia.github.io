accomplishments:
- 'I led multiple brainstorm sessions to fine tune the direction and priorities for
  development work each week. This iterative design process led to rapid and evolving
  prototypes being put in front of potential clients at a regular pace. While each
  version was more complex than the last, we were able to incorporate every change
  into a growing and scalable architecture for future application development.

I lead design and development of the MVP front end experience for their web based SaaS product. I was responsible for designing the application user experience based on collected user research, creating data visualizations to communicate business analytics, collecting and integrating feedback from user tests, developing the AngularJS/Bootstrap based front end code base, designing the REST APIs, and collaborating with the CEO and co-founders on product strategy and roadmap.

    I led multiple brainstorm sessions to fine tune the direction 
    and priorities for each weekâ€™s development work. This iterative design process led 
    to rapid and evolving prototypes being put in front of potential clients at a regular 
    pace. While each version was more complex than the last, we were able to incorporate 
    every change into a growing and scalable architecture for future application development.

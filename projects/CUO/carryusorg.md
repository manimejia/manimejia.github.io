In spring 2016, I founded this tech startup to support charitable athletes in doing good and going further. We are designing a web/mobile app which will enable individuals and teams to raise money for any charity, while advancing their athletic goals and covering their campaign expenses.

As the primary founding member of this early stage startup, I have identified the audience and problem to solve, designed a product and suite of services to address this problem, and designed a business plan and a marketing campaign around this solution.

We are currently a team of 3, working part time to develop an MVP applicaiton and establish market traction for a beta launch in late summer 2016.

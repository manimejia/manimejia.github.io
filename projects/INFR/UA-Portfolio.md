    maintained clear communication 
    with the designers, developers, clients, and investors, 
    providing each project with efficient use of precious 
    meeting time and continuous progress toward its commonly 
    understood goals.

    I dove head on into javascript development using AngularJS. 
    It was my first of many adventures with this thick-client framework, 
    yet so far from a beginner’s lesson. With deep understanding of the application’s 
    growing UI requirements, I was able to re-architect the entire front end to deliver 
    a more polished and scalable solution in less time than other estimates.

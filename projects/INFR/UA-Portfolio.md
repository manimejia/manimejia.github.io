accomplishments:
- "maintained clear communication \nwith the designers, developers, clients, and investors,
  \nproviding each project with efficient use of precious \nmeeting time and continuous
  progress toward its commonly \nunderstood goals.\n"
- "I dove head on into javascript development using AngularJS. \nIt was my first of
  many adventures with this thick-client framework, \nyet so far from a beginners
  lesson. With deep understanding of the application \ngrowing UI requirements, I
  was able to re-architect the entire front end to deliver \na more polished and scalable
  solution in less time than other estimates.\n"

I was responsible for refining the user experiences, developing UI widgets, re-architecting the client side code base, and streamlining the REST APIs.

    maintained clear communication 
    with the designers, developers, clients, and investors, 
    providing each project with efficient use of precious 
    meeting time and continuous progress toward its commonly 
    understood goals.

    I dove head on into javascript development using AngularJS. 
    It was my first of many adventures with this thick-client framework, 
    yet so far from a beginners lesson. With deep understanding of the application 
    growing UI requirements, I was able to re-architect the entire front end to deliver 
    a more polished and scalable solution in less time than other estimates.

I was responsible for refining the user experiences, developing UI widgets, re-architecting the client side code base, and streamlining the REST APIs.

Ani Phyo is a leading personality in the field of healthy living and nutrition education. She is a published author and host of her own raw food cooking show. By the time we met, I had my name known as a website developer in the raw food community. She needed just a few tweaks to her Xcart system, and the job went quickly and smoothly. It really wasn't creative work, but allowed me to build my reputation and establish her as a professional contact.

In 2001, I proposed, designed, and built a unique multimedia [virtual tour][BFVT] of the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary campus. It was modeled after the [Sydney Opera House virtual tour][SOVT], developed in 2001 by [Tony Cray][TDC]. While such a product was ahead of it's time and typically out of budget for a growing non-profit, the roadmap I presented was practical and achievable, with clear benefits for all. Utilizing the RIA capabilities of Flash 5, we redefined the landscape of interactive web presentations, putting Best Friends on the map with a dynamic Internet presence and a handful of spinning furry friends.

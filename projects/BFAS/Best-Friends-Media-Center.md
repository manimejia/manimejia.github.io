After many years as a freelance website and multimedia developer, Best Friends asked me back as a "flash expert" to collaborate on the development of a new video publishing  web application. You tube had just hit the scene hard, and they wanted to have the next best thing in the animal care community. They had decided to build this application using Adobe Flash, and brought me in as a UX Architect and ActionScript Consultant. Over the course of a few months, we nailed down the requirements, drew up wireframes of multiple fidelity, diagramed the class architecture, and roughed out a proof-of-concept in AS3.

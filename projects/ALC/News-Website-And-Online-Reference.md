Laura Allen is an lawyer specializing in animal advocacy cases nationwide. When she noticed a distinct void in the accessibility and availability of information related to animal rights laws, she consulted with me about putting up a website to address this growing need. The website was to be a place for her and her staff to post articles on new developments in animal related legal issues. It was also intended to provide a comprehensive listing of all local and national animal related laws. She wanted to supply the existing community of activists and advocacy groups with this needed information. 

When she approached me, I had already been deep into Drupal for a year, so it was a no brainer to develop her site using this remarkably flexible platform.

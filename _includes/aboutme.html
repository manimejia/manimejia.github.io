        As a web professional since 2001, Manuel offers a full spectrum and people-centered approach to software development and experience design. In client presentations, you will find him reading between the lines to capture the unstated stories, and offering them back in a language that makes sense. In team meetings, he presents these stories as a cohesive unit, using mockups and diagrams to convey a sensible user-focused architecture. When it's time for coding, he keeps one eye on the client's prize and one on the dev bench; always working between these worlds and making sense of both. If ever there are issues, he remains calm and focused on winning solutions, while keeping the doors of communication wide open. This is the people-centered and multi-discipline practice in which Manuel excels; and what makes his clients and employers happy.

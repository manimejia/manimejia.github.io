        User Experience Architect</h4>
        <p>
        A people watcher from day one, my constant observations of movement and space keep me connected to the real world needs of experience design. From logical page layouts to clearly written copy to meaningful use of colors and shapes, I am always on the lookout for ways to shape the interactive experience, and drive attention to the content that matters.

        Web Developer</h4>
        <p>
        As an insufferable tinkerer, you will often find me neck deep in code trying to make better software. This 'no fear' attitude has exposed me to a variety of programming tools and methodologies over the years, and allowed me to stay current with the changing landscape. As a self taught professional, I bring a well-rounded skillset to any development team.

        Multimedia Creative</h4>
        <p>
        Thinking out side the box is so last decade. This digital playground we call the "web" is capable of so much, it could be said that even thinking outside the "page" is so late decade. In this era of rich media and immersive experiences, content for the web can be made in any variety of medium to be delivered on any platform. Hey... Diversity is our strength.

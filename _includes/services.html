        UX Architect</h4>
        <p>
        A people watcher from day one, my awareness of movement and space keeps me connected to the real world needs of user experience design. From logical page layouts to clearly written copy to meaningful use of colors and shapes, I am always on the lookout for ways to shape the interactive experience, and drive attention to the content that matters.

        Web Developer</h4>
        <p>
        As an insufferable tinkerer, you will often find me neck deep in code trying to make better software. This 'no fear' attitude has exposed me to a variety of programming tools and methodologies over the years, and allowed me to stay current with the changing landscape. As a self taught professional, I bring a well-rounded skill set to any development team.

        Thinking out side the box is so last decade. We must now think outside the <em>page</em>, in this evolving digital playground called "Web 2.0". The demand for rich media and immersive content is only getting <b>bigger</b>. This new breed of content must also be smart and context aware to be accessible to all people and all devices. The future is now. <em>Carpe Diem</em>
